## What it does

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Repositories** | Clone or update multi-protocol repos (git, hg, svn, bzr, tar, zip) from a single YAML file |
| **Skills** | Download and install `SKILL.md` collections into your local AI agent directories (Claude, Copilot, Cursor, …) |
| **MCPs** | Upsert MCP server entries into agent JSON config files without overwriting your existing configuration |

---

## Quick start

The fastest way to get a working `gaal.yaml` is to run the interactive init
wizard. It scans your machine for installed skills and MCP servers, asks you
a few questions, and writes a configuration you can sync right away.

```bash
gaal init
```

The wizard asks two questions before doing anything:

1. **How** to create the file — start from an empty documented skeleton, or
   import the skills and MCP servers detected on this machine.
2. **Where** the configuration applies — project-scoped (`./gaal.yaml`) or
   global-scoped (`~/.config/gaal/config.yaml`).

When you pick the import mode, gaal runs an audit under the selected scope
and presents a multi-select list grouped by agent. Everything is preselected
by default; press Enter to confirm, or Space to toggle individual entries.

### Non-interactive (CI / scripts)

The wizard prompts are bypassable via flags:

```bash
# Empty skeleton, project-scoped
gaal init --empty --scope project

# Import everything detected, global-scoped, overwrite existing file
gaal init --import-all --scope global --force
```

`--empty` and `--import-all` are mutually exclusive; one of them is required
when stdin is not a TTY.

### Manual setup

If you would rather hand-write your configuration, copy `example.gaal.yaml`
and edit it. A minimal file looks like this:

```yaml
repositories:
  src/myrepo:
    type: git
    url: https://github.com/example/myrepo.git
    version: main

skills:
  - source: vercel-labs/agent-skills
    agents: ["*"]

mcps:
  - name: filesystem
    target: ~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json
    inline:
      command: uvx
      args: [mcp-server-filesystem, /home/user/projects]
```

Then run:

```bash
gaal sync
```

---

## Usage

### One-shot sync

```bash
gaal sync
```

Clones or updates all repositories, installs skills, and upserts MCP entries.

### Dry-run (preview changes)

```bash
gaal sync --dry-run
```

Runs the full sync planning pipeline but performs no writes to disk.
Prints what sync *would* do — which repos would be cloned or updated,
which skills would be installed, and which MCP entries would be created.

Supports `--output table|json` and `--sandbox`. Incompatible with `--service`.

Exit codes: **0** = nothing to change, **1** = changes pending, **2** = error.

### Continuous service mode

```bash
gaal sync --service --interval 10m
```

Runs a sync loop every 10 minutes. Handles `SIGTERM` / `Ctrl-C` cleanly.

### Status report

```bash
gaal status
```

Prints the current state of every repository, skill, and MCP entry.

### Detailed info

```bash
gaal info <repo|skill|mcp|agent> [name]
```

Shows a full information card for every entry of the given package type, combining the configuration spec with the current runtime state.

```bash
gaal info skill                          # all skill entries
gaal info skill vercel-labs/agent-skills # filter by source (substring, case-insensitive)
gaal info repo workspace/myrepo
gaal info mcp claude
gaal info agent                          # list all registered agents
gaal info agent cursor
```

### List agents

```bash
gaal agents                  # all registered agents (installed first)
gaal agents --installed      # only agents detected on this machine
gaal agents cursor           # detailed view for one agent
gaal agents -o json          # machine-readable output
```

Lists every registered coding agent and whether it is installed on this machine.
Pass a name for a detailed view with search paths, skill counts, and MCP config.

### Health check

```bash
gaal doctor
```

Runs sanity checks on your configuration: validates gaal.yaml, checks that
skill sources are reachable, verifies MCP target files, and reports agent
and telemetry status.

```bash
gaal doctor --offline     # skip network checks
gaal doctor --no-upsell   # suppress the Community Edition message
gaal doctor -o json       # machine-readable JSON output
```

Exit codes: **0** = all checks passed, **1** = warnings, **2** = errors.

### Generate the JSON Schema

```bash
gaal schema
```

Prints the JSON Schema (draft-07) that describes the full structure of a `gaal.yaml`
configuration file. Useful for IDE validation, documentation, and LLM JSON mode.

```bash
gaal schema -f schema.json   # write to a file
```

**VS Code:** the workspace `settings.json` already maps `schema.json` to every
`*.gaal.yaml` file — run `gaal schema -f schema.json` once and YAML
auto-completion / inline validation activate automatically.

**GoLand / IntelliJ:** go to _Languages & Frameworks → Schemas and DTDs →
JSON Schema Mappings_, add `schema.json` and associate it with your `gaal.yaml` files.

---

### Output format

Both `status` and `info` support the `-o` / `--output` flag:

```bash
gaal status -o json        # machine-readable JSON
gaal info repo -o json
```

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `table` | Human-friendly coloured tables (default) |
| `json`  | Structured JSON, suitable for scripting / CI |

When `--output json` is set the ASCII banner is automatically suppressed.

### Sandbox mode (safe for CI / testing)

```bash
gaal --sandbox /tmp/my-sandbox sync
```

Redirects all writes to the sandbox directory. Nothing outside it is touched.

### Custom config file

```bash
gaal --config /path/to/custom.yaml sync
```

### Suppress the banner

```bash
gaal --no-banner sync
```

### Verbose / debug output

```bash
gaal --verbose sync
```

### Log to file (JSON)

```bash
gaal --log-file /var/log/gaal.json sync
```

### Shell completion

gaal generates completion scripts for **bash**, **zsh**, **fish**, and **PowerShell**.

**Bash — current session**
```bash
source <(gaal completion bash)
```

**Bash — permanent** (add to `~/.bashrc`)
```bash
gaal completion bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/gaal
```

**Zsh — current session**
```zsh
source <(gaal completion zsh)
```

**Zsh — permanent**
```zsh
gaal completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_gaal"
```

**Fish**
```fish
gaal completion fish | source
# or permanently:
gaal completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/gaal.fish
```

**PowerShell**
```powershell
gaal completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

## Configuration reference

See [`example.gaal.yaml`](example.gaal.yaml) for a fully annotated configuration.

gaal merges up to three configuration files in order:

| Priority | File |
|----------|------|
| 1 — lowest | `/etc/gaal/config.yaml` (global) |
| 2 | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gaal/config.yaml` (user, defaults to `~/.config/gaal/config.yaml` on Linux and macOS) |
| 3 — highest | `gaal.yaml` in CWD, or `--config` path |

### Schema stability

Every `gaal.yaml` file should declare `schema: 1` as its first field:

```yaml
schema: 1
repositories: {}
skills: []
mcps: []
```

gaal Lite commits to reading `schema: 1` configs forever. Future releases may add optional fields, but breaking changes will only ship under `schema: 2` (or higher) with a documented migration path. You can adopt gaal Lite today knowing your config file will keep working.

### Agent registry customization

gaal ships with a built-in registry of supported coding agents (claude-code, github-copilot, cursor, windsurf, …). You can extend it with your own agent definitions by creating a file at:

| OS | Path |
|----|------|
| Linux | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gaal/agents.yaml` (defaults to `~/.config/gaal/agents.yaml`) |
| macOS | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gaal/agents.yaml` (defaults to `~/.config/gaal/agents.yaml`) |
| Windows | `%AppData%\gaal\agents.yaml` |

Custom entries **extend** the built-in list — they cannot override built-in entries. Each entry follows the same format as the built-in registry:

```yaml
agents:
  my-agent:
    project_skills_dir: .my-agent/skills   # relative path, no ".."
    global_skills_dir: ~/.my-agent/skills  # must start with ~/
    mcp_config_file: ~/.my-agent/mcp.json  # empty string if unsupported
```

Use `gaal agents` to list all registered agents (built-in + custom) and verify your additions. `gaal info agent` provides the same information in an alternative layout.

## Graduation path to gaal Community

When your team outgrows single-user Lite (shared configs, drift detection,
approval workflows), gaal Community Edition picks up where Lite leaves off.

The migration command validates your current configuration and confirms it is
ready to push to a Community instance:

```bash
gaal migrate --to community https://community.example.com
gaal migrate --to community https://community.example.com --dry-run
```

Community Edition is not yet publicly available. Running `gaal migrate` today
validates your YAML and prints what would be migrated. Subscribe at
<https://getgaal.com> to be notified when Community ships.
